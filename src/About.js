          <h2>What is Music?</h2>Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of 
     melodies and harmony and which soothes you. Music may also refer to the art of composing 
     such pleasant sounds with the help of the various musical instruments. A person who knows
      music is a Musician.
      The music consists of Sargam, Ragas, Taals, etc. Music is not only what 
      is composed of men but also which exists in nature. Have you ever heard the sound
      of a waterfall or a flowing river? Could you hear music there? Thus, everything in 
      harmony has music. Here, I would like to quote a line by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 
      one of the greatest musicians,
      “The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.”</div>

Music has great qualities of healing a person emotionally and mentally. Music is a form of meditation.
 While composing or listening music ones tends to forget all his worries, sorrows and pains.
  But, in order to appreciate good music, we need to cultivate our musical taste.

  flowed from Lord Krishna’s flute. They would surrender themselves to Him. Also, the research has 
  proved that the plants which hear the Music grow at a faster rate in comparison to the others.</div>
